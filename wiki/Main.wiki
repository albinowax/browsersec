=Introduction=

Hello, and welcome to the _Browser Security Handbook_!

This document is meant to provide web application developers, browser engineers, and information security researchers with a one-stop reference to key security properties of contemporary web browsers. Insufficient understanding of these often poorly-documented characteristics is a major contributing factor to the prevalence of several classes of security vulnerabilities.

Although all browsers implement roughly the same set of baseline features, there is relatively little standardization - or conformance to standards - when it comes to many of the less apparent implementation details. Furthermore, vendors routinely introduce proprietary tweaks or improvements that may interfere with existing features in non-obvious ways, and seldom provide a detailed discussion of potential problems.

The current version of this document is based on the following versions of web browsers:

*Please note that although we tried to make this document as accurate as possible, some errors might have slipped through. Use this document only as an initial reference, and independently verify any characteristics you wish to depend upon. Test cases for properties featured in this document are [http://browsersec.googlecode.com/files/browser_tests-1.00.tar.gz freely available for download].*

The document attempts to capture the risks and security considerations present for general populace of users accessing the web with default browser settings in place. Although occasionally noted, the degree of flexibility offered through non-standard settings is by itself not a subject of this comparative study.

Through the document, <font color="#ff0000">red color</font> is used to bring attention to browser properties seeem particularly tricky or unexpected, and need to be carefully accounted for in server-side implementations. Whenever status quo appears to bear no significant security consequences and is well-understood, but a particular browser implementation takes additional steps to protect application developers, we use <font color="#30ff30">green color</font> to denote this, likewise. Rest assured, neither of these color codes implies that a particular browser is less or more secure than its counterparts.
